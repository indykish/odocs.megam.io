Onboard cloud documentation

This is the documentation for the onboard cloud project which helps to unpack, configure hardware to top $$$.

# Motivatioin

Historically we had tries many times using 
## [USB with ISO](https://github.com/megamsys/gitpackager/tree/master/megdc/usb) 

This would install the customized operation systemd and start an control pane inside an
on premise datacenter to do that what they want. The control pane was built using `golang` and had a web interface. 

This inherently has tight order of unpacking vanilla hardware to cloud using a specific order that an admin would do via USB.
